                        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts <br/>
                        they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe&#46; Understanding<br/>
                        the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various<br/>
                        privacy laws that protect personal information&#46;
